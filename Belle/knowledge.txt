About the Chatbot Belle project:
This project was developed by Phat, a student at Ho Chi Minh City University of Industry and Trade (HUIT).
Belle Chatbot was built using MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
The project initially planned to use Live2D but failed after 12 hours, so it switched to a UI interface inspired by Zenless Zone Zero.

Phat likes programming, playing ZZZ games and especially likes the character Belle.
Phat is studying Artificial Intelligence and Web Programming.
